## Overview

Project contains a caching matrix inverse solver. Given a square matrix, the inverse solution will be computed and cached for future use. The function 'cacheSolve()' is equivalent to the 'solve()' function in {base} with a caching layer added. Get and set methods are provided for both the original values and the inverse matrix solution.
